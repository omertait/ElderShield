# IOT-Final-Project- Fall Detection


## Overview

ElderShield is an innovative IoT solution designed to enhance the safety and well-being of elderly individuals living alone. By leveraging the power of modern technology and the Internet, ElderShield acts as a virtual guardian, providing peace of mind to both the elderly and their loved ones. This project combines an ESP32 microcontroller, various sensors, and internet connectivity via Blynk and Make to create a wearable and adaptable system that ensures timely assistance in critical situations.

## Features

- **Fall Detection**: Utilizes an MPU6050 accelerometer and gyroscope sensor to detect sudden falls, automatically sending an alert to predefined emergency contacts.
- **Shower Monitoring**: An embedded humidity sensor monitors the duration of shower activities. If an unusually long shower time is detected, indicating a potential issue, it triggers an alert to emergency contacts.
- **Remote Check-Ins**: Loved ones can send "poke" messages via the internet, prompting the user with visual (LED) and auditory (speaker) signals. The user can respond using physical package sensors, reassuring their safety.
- **Internet-Connected**: Through Blynk and Make, ElderShield maintains a constant connection for real-time monitoring and alerts.
